            <p>
                In 1752 Francois Boucher painted this work and its pair, The Rising of the Sun, as ‘cartoons’ (a kind of
                really intense sketch or model to work off) for tapestries that were being made to be hung in
                Versailles, in the bedroom of Louis XV. They were commissioned by Madame de Pomapadour, who was the
                King’s mistress and also held considerable political power in the court. Both paintings depict Apollo,
                the sun god, bringing light to the world, and the nymph Tethys is shown assisting him. This represents
                the King and Madame de Pomapadour; she basically commissioned works to hang in his bedroom to remind him
                how amazing she is. Power move.
                <br>
                But that’s not what I’m here to tell you about. I promised balloons.
                My absolute favourite thing about this painting is all the flying babies; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putto" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Opens in new tab">'putti'</a>, as they are
                officially called. Boucher paints each putto with such a lightness and fluffiness that they look like
                they are floating away; there is one on the right that even has to hold onto his mates coz he’s about to
                fly away like Charlie and his grandpa in that one scene of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Add in
                everyone rolling around in the water at the bottom of the scene, and the figures gliding around in the
                clouds, and you couldn’t have a floatier picture.
