# Odd Art History

## Purpose

The purpose of the site is to provide interesting information about art history, specifically older paintings. The information is aimed to be presented to users who may consider the topic boring or uninteresting, or interested users who are looking for something new.
The site was built to fulfill the requirements of Project Portfolio 1 for the Code Institute’s Diploma in Software Development.

## UX Considerations

For part of the site I used a hub and spoke design, with the Gallery (landing) page as the hub and the 3 painting pages as spokes. These pages do not appear on the navigation bar but can only be accessed from the links on the Gallery page.
The reason for this design for the paintings is to bring a sense of playfulness to the website. It would be simple to add in nav links for each painting, either with the painting title or their ‘hint’ word (heels, bushes, balloon), but I feel this would take away from the intrigue and mystery of discovering information about the paintings.

I have included the Gallery, Odd Resources and Suggestions page on the nav bar so that the rest of the site is still clear and simple to navigate, as I don’t want the users to be frustrated or overloaded. I would like to introduce a small amount of playfulness and intrigue but not so much that it becomes tiring or frustrating.

## Design colour schemes and typography

I used colormind.io to choose a colour scheme, and Google Fonts for the typography. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/colormind-palette-snip-1-red-hlight.JPG">
</p>

I ended up altering the colour scheme a little as the light blue I originally chose did not have a high enough contrast with the text. #49AECB was replaced with #8FDCF1 using the Gitpod dropper tool. I chose a scheme with one red accent, to mirror Louis XIV’s heels in Rigaud’s portrait.

For the fonts, Oxygen is used for the headings/titles and Fira Sans for the main content, with Sans Serif as a back-up for both.

## Features

Features across all pages
* clear header and site ‘slogan’ describing site purpose
* navigation bar listing Gallery, Odd Resources, Suggestions and Say Hi (which will link to social media)
* footer mirroring design of navigation bar, which will link back to top of page

Gallery (home/landing page)
* three main images that link to painting pages - each one is a ‘hint’ of the painting, with a hint word and hint image. 
* images are page width on all devices with the hint word as a link to the painting page

Painting pages (x3, ‘heels’, ‘bushes’, ‘balloons’)
* spokes from gallery hub (design choice explained in UX section of readme)

* text about painting with link back to gallery page for easy navigation

Suggestions page
* easy to use form for users to suggest paintings
* optional to provide contact details (theoretically if site user chooses a  painting, they would contact the user and ask if okay to use their name, or possibly for more info)
