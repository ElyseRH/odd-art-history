            <p>
                You might recognise this painting; apparently <a href="https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2013/12/10/look-what-we-found-in-frozen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Opens in new tab">it’s in Frozen</a> and it’s been kicking around since roughly 1767 so you may have come across the image during your time on earth.
                <br>
                The original patron, whose identity is now unknown, commissioned a portrait of him and his mistress from
                the painter Gabriel Francois Doyen. Presumably he had somewhere to put the painting where his wife was
                never going to see it, or this was how he was planning to break the news. Doyen refused because he was
                very uncomfortable with the subject matter, and suggested Fragonard for the job. Fragonard was sick of
                serious history paintings and looking forward to some frivolous commissions, so he wholeheartedly
                accepted.
                <br>
                The painting features the mistress on a swing in a beautiful pink dress, in the process of losing a
                suggestive shoe to her lover, who is lying in the bushes. I guess he got tired from all that sneaking
                around. The other guy in the painting, the one pushing the swing, was originally meant to be a bishop.
                Fragonard swapped the bishop out for a generic older man; I guess he didn’t want to enable the patron
                quite THAT much.
                <br>
                This painting has been parodied and reproduced many times since the 1700s; my personal favourite reproduction of this painting is Kate Beaton’s, where the two-timer gets a shoe
                to the face and our frilly pink swinger <a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=337" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Opens in new tab">gets a good book.</a>
