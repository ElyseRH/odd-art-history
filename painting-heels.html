        <div class="painting-info">
            <p>
                In 1701 Hyacinthe Rigaud completed an epic portrait of King Louis XIV of France, standing literally 9
                feet tall. In the portrait he wears a fabulous pair of shoes with a striking red heel. Rigaud painted
                the king in his pumps because during the court of the Sun King (as Louis was known), the king closely
                controlled who could and couldn’t wear shoes with red heels.
                <br>
                He issued an official edict that only members of his court were allowed to wear red heels; red heels
                meant you were in favour with the king, meaning that this painting was a not-so-subtle reminder of the power he
                could give or take away.
                <br>
                Louis was reported to be 5ft 4in in height, which was not considered very kingly at the time. He
                regularly donned heels of up to 10cm, and may have tried to control the height of those around him, not
                allowing anyone to have a heel higher than his own.
                <br>
                You can buy figurines in the Louvre giftshop, complete with wig and cloak. They’re only 10cm tall
                tip-to-toe so I don’t think Louis would be too impressed.
